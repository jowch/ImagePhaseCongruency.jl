However the two filters can be packed together as a complex valued
matrix, one in the real part and one in the imaginary part.  Do this
by multiplying H2 by i and then adding it to H1.  When the convolution
is performed via the fft the real part of the result will correspond
to the convolution with H1 and the imaginary part with H2.  This
allows the two convolutions to be done as one in the frequency domain,
saving time and memory.

homomorphic - Performs homomorphic filtering on an image.

strong backlighting.

perfft2 -  2D Fourier transform of Moisan's periodic image component
```
Usage: (P, S, p, s) = perfft2(img)

Argument: img - Image to be transformed
Returns:    P - 2D fft of periodic image component
            S - 2D fft of smooth component
            p - Periodic component (spatial domain)
            s - Smooth component (spatial domain)
```
Moisan's "Periodic plus Smooth Image Decomposition" decomposes an image
into two components

        `img = p + s`

where s is the 'smooth' component with mean 0 and p is the 'periodic'
component which has no sharp discontinuities when one moves cyclically
across the image boundaries.

This decomposition is very useful when one wants to obtain an FFT of
an image with minimal artifacts introduced from the boundary
discontinuities.  The image p gathers most of the image information
but avoids periodization artifacts.

The typical use of this function is to obtain a 'periodic only' fft of an
image

     `P = perfft2(img)`

Displaying the amplitude spectrum of P will yield a clean spectrum without the
typical vertical-horizontal 'cross' arising from the image boundaries that you
would normally see.

Note if you are using the function to perform filtering in the frequency
domain you may want to retain s (the smooth component in the spatial domain)
and add it back to the filtered result at the end.

The computational cost of obtaining the 'periodic only' FFT involves taking an
additional FFT.

geoseries - Generate geometric series

Useful for generating geometrically scaled wavelengths for specifying
filter banks.

```
Usage 1: s = geoseries(s1, mult, n)

Arguments:      s1 - The starting value in the series.
              mult - The scaling factor between succesive values.
                 n - The desired number of elements in the series.

Usage 2: s = geoseries((s1, sn), n)

Arguments: (s1, sn) - Tuple specifying the 1st and last values
                      in the the series.
                  n - The desired number of elements in the series.
```

Example: s = geoseries(0.5, 2, 4)
```
      s =  [0.5000,    1.0000,    2.0000,    4.0000]
```
 Alternatively obtain the same series using
```
           s = geoseries((0.5, 4), 4)
```
